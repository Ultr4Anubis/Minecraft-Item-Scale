<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This was my first solo python project I have created. It has allowed me to imporve my understanding and ability to use the language.

Here's why this project is useful:
* Is script automates a very boring and tedious task that no-one wants to do
* It takes about 2 seconds to generate your scale values
* It automatically puts your values into the `render_offset` component ready for you to just copy and paste into your code. :smile:

<!-- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION -->
## Additional Information

If you do not have python installed on your device, dont fear. You can use this online compiler to run the code: [Online Compiler](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/)
* Make sure to copy the code from the `scale.py` file
* Delete the current code inside the Online complier
* Paste the contents of the `scale.py` file inside the left side of the compiler
* Hit run and follow the steps in the terminal, the left side of the compiler
* **Note** Once you have pasted the code inside the left side of the compiler, do not type in that section, all inputs should be entered inside the terminal
